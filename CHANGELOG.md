# Changelog

## [0.12.6] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Fix WebGL glyph corruption after long sessions: combine clearTextureAtlas + term.refresh for full redraw (clearTextureAtlas alone caused page distortion during 5-min refresh)
- Restore WebGL renderer for table/box-drawing continuity (revert v0.12.4 removal that caused visible cell gaps in DOM renderer)
- Unify terminal disposal via disposeTerminal helper to prevent atlas timer leaks

## [0.12.5] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- Fix long-session glyph corruption (boxes with random ASCII letters) by periodically clearing WebGL texture atlas every 5 minutes, working around @xterm/addon-webgl@0.19.0 race condition bug (xtermjs/xterm.js#4325)
- Unify terminal disposal via disposeTerminal helper to prevent atlas timer leaks across tab close / restart / unmount

### Changed
- Restore WebGL renderer for better table/box-drawing continuity (DOM renderer showed visible gaps between cells)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-06-25

- Fix utf8_complete_boundary missing mid-buffer invalid bytes that triggered spurious GBK fallback

### Changed
- Introduce stateful PtyDecoder replacing carry buffer + boundary + decode_output triplet

- Simplify read_output_loop from ~100 to ~50 lines
- Remove obsolete utf8_complete_boundary and utf8_seq_len helpers

## [0.12.3] - 2026-06-25

- Fix terminal mojibake on mixed UTF-8/GBK output: replace whole-buffer GBK fallback with greedy scan (UTF-8 multibyte priority, GBK double-byte fallback per segment, U+FFFD last resort)
- Fix multi-byte character corruption across PTY read boundaries (incomplete UTF-8 sequences and GBK lead bytes now buffered to next read)
- Fix utf8_complete_boundary missing mid-buffer invalid bytes by replacing with stateful PtyDecoder::find_safe_boundary

### Changed
- Introduce stateful PtyDecoder replacing carry + utf8_complete_boundary + decode_output triplet
- Rewrite decode_output with platform-unified greedy scan (remove #[cfg(target_os = "windows")] branch)

- Simplify read_output_loop from ~100 lines to ~50 lines

### Tests
- Add 17 PtyDecoder tests covering cross-read UTF-8/GBK, isolated invalid bytes, flush, deadlock prevention, performance baseline (10KB < 100ms)
- Add 5 decode_output tests covering UTF-8+GBK mixing, isolated invalid bytes, 4-byte emoji, all-platform GBK

## [0.12.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
