# Unified Workspace UX execution ledger

## Durable execution policy

This branch is an append-only remote checkpoint for the unified workspace implementation.

For every implementation task:

1. Write and run the task's failing tests.
2. Implement the smallest passing change.
3. Run the task's targeted verification locally.
4. Commit the complete task as an atomic commit.
5. Push the commit to `feat/unified-workspace-ux` immediately.
6. Verify that the remote branch HEAD equals the local commit SHA.
7. Record the task, test command, result, and remote SHA in this ledger.
8. Only then begin the next task.

Rules:

- Do not force-push or rewrite remotely checkpointed task commits.
- Do not open a pull request until the implementation and visual design are frozen.
- Feature-branch checkpoint pushes must not be used to trigger CI.
- If remote synchronization fails, create a Git bundle and source snapshot, retain the workspace, mark the task `BLOCKED_SYNC`, and do not count it as remotely complete.
- Final CI and the Windows installer workflow run only after Task 25 freeze.

## Current verified remote state

- Branch: `feat/unified-workspace-ux`
- Verified remote baseline before this ledger: `707e5a0ff100acb69550c1f600c7d97f87b8d01a`
- Design specification: complete
- Implementation plan: complete
- Task 1: complete and present in remote history
- Task 2 frontend and persistence implementation: locally verified; remote checkpoint pending
- Task 3 Legacy Claude adapter: locally verified; remote checkpoint pending
- Next implementation task: Task 4 — Native CLI session adapter and history cache

## Task checkpoints

| Task | Status | Tests | Remote commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | complete | relative time, session presentation, safe user-error mapping | `04370fdc22e41fa07ed61546d9b6e5d15ac69e35` |
| 2 | local checkpoint; Rust filtered tests pending toolchain | 135 targeted + 903 full frontend tests, typecheck, build | pending remote sync |
| 3 | local checkpoint | 41 targeted + 907 full frontend tests, typecheck, build | pending remote sync |

## Rulings

- Task 2: added typed IPC mutations (`upsert_session_ui_record`, `remove_session_ui_record`, `set_project_launch_preference`) and their frontend wrappers. The shared writer cannot safely persist the new fields through the existing legacy pin/archive/display-name mutations alone. Cost if wrong: a broader Tauri command surface requiring final Rust review.
- Task 2: local environment has no Rust toolchain and outbound DNS is unavailable, so filtered Rust tests cannot run in this workspace. Frontend gates are green; the checkpoint remains explicitly Rust-pending until the final Windows/Rust gate runs. Cost if wrong: a Rust compile/test defect may be discovered at final CI rather than this checkpoint.

- Task 3: Legacy runtime operations are injected through `LegacyClaudeRuntimePort` rather than implemented inside the Pinia store. Process ownership remains in the terminal host, while the adapter owns projection and routing. Cost if wrong: Task 11 must supply a complete runtime bridge before the adapter can be used in production.
- Task 3: Windows-style project paths are normalized case-insensitively even when tests execute on Linux, because persisted Windows identities must remain stable across build/test hosts. Cost if wrong: a case-sensitive Windows-like path on Linux would be merged.
